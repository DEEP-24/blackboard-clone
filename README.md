 # Project Description
 Blackboard is a powerful digital tool for academic schools that makes it easier for teachers, students, and administrators to work together. As modern education changes, Blackboard becomes the perfect way to connect tools, communication, and intellectual knowledge in a way that is easy to use.

 # Features
 Admin Module: 

 - **Manage Courses**: Maintain and improve the list of classes to make sure that the program is always current.
 - **Manage Faculty**: Control centralized over faculties.
 - **Manage Rooms**: Maintain the rooms by creating new rooms allocating room number and maxCapacity.
 - **Manage Departments**: Maintain the departments.
 - **Manage Sections**: Manage the sections by creating and editing them.
 - **Manage Students**: Can view the students who are currently using the blackboard.

 # Faculty Module:
 - **View Assigned Sections:** Access a detailed view of teaching assignments, students, and class schedules.
 - **Upload Documents:** Share educational content such as lecture slides, assignments, and supplemental materials with enrolled students.

 # Student Module:
 - **View Available Sections:** Overview of sections open for registration.
 - **Enroll in Sections:** Option to sign up for preferred classes.
 - **Access Section Resources:** Access resources (documents) uploaded by faculty or instructors.

 # Benefits:
 Blackboard is meant to change the way education works by making sure everything is well organized, cutting down on administrative work, making the most of available resources, and encouraging open conversation between all parties. As a tool that can be changed, Blackboard can easily add more advanced features in the future to make learning even better.


 # Technologies Used:

- **Remix Framework:**
  Serving as the backbone of the platform, the Remix framework enhances the web development process. It allows for faster navigation and a more efficient server-rendered experience, harnessing the best of modern web functionalities.

- **React Library:**
  Integral to the frontend, React's component-based architecture ensures a dynamic, responsive, and intuitive user interface. Its virtual DOM implementation guarantees optimal performance during updates and renders.

- **NodeJS:**
  Powering the backend, NodeJS provides a lightweight, efficient runtime for building fast and scalable server-side applications. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it ideal for handling concurrent requests.

- **TypeScript:**
  Enhancing JavaScript by adding static types, TypeScript brings better readability and robustness to the codebase. It aids in catching errors early, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

- **TailwindCSS:**
  This utility-first CSS framework accelerates the UI development process, allowing for rapid design iterations and a consistent, responsive design across Blackboard.

 **AWS Services:**

- **S3 Bucket:**
  Leveraged for its durability and scalability, AWS's S3 Bucket is employed to store and manage documents uploaded by faculty. This ensures secure, reliable, and fast access to academic resources.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service):**
  Acting as the central data store, AWS RDS houses the project's relational databases. It ensures seamless scaling, backups, and high availability, underpinning the vital data interactions within Blackboard.
